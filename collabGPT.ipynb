        "Welcome to **CollabGPT** — a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built with **Cohere’s embedding models**. This notebook lets you upload multiple PDF documents and ask natural language questions about them using a Gradio-powered chatbot interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🚀 What This Notebook Does:\n",
        "1. 📄 Upload multiple PDFs (research papers, reports, etc.)\n",
        "2. 🔍 Extract and split text into meaningful chunks\n",
        "3. 🧠 Generate embeddings using **Cohere’s `embed-english-v3.0` model**\n",
        "4. 🔎 Match your query with the most relevant chunks using cosine similarity\n",
        "5. 💬 Use the matched content as context to answer your questions\n",
        "6. 🧑‍💻 Interact with a **Gradio UI** to ask anything from your documents\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📚 Use Case Examples:\n",
        "- Summarize PDF content\n",
        "- Ask questions like “What are the key findings?”\n",
        "- Extract definitions or bullet points from dense documents\n",
        "- Academic literature review\n",
        "- Product or policy document Q&A\n",
